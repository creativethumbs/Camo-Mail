# Camo-Mail

The blatant discrepancy between how our digital and physical mail are handled is disturbing. Camo Mail is a project that attempts to close this discrepancy: it is a simple message encryption program that takes an email message and adds a space between each letter. The result is a message with content that is still human-readable, but useless to email scanners programmed to detect specific words or phrases.

To use, simply go to the dist folder and download the binary. 

**Edit**:

It seems that this no longer works due to more rigid security measures taken by mail services.
