# Camo-Mail

The blatant discrepancy between how our digital and physical mail are handled is disturbing. Camo Mail is a project that attempts to close this discrepancy: it is a simple message encryption program that takes an email message and adds a space between each letter. The result is a message with content that is still human-readable, but useless to email scanners programmed to detect specific words or phrases.

How to use it:

1. Download the zip file.
2. Type your email in the email.txt file.
3. Run `python camomail.py`--the newly formatted email will be shown
4. If you want to save the new email into a file, run `python camomail.py > [YOUR FILE NAME].txt`
