Privacy is a privilege that is rarely enjoyed in the age of the Internet. As we browse the web our every action is monitored by countless trackers, who then use the information to subject us to advertising that we really don't care about. This fact is true for the supposedly 'private' emailing services as well: each incoming and outgoing message is automatically analyzed by software dedicated to generating targeted advertisements and catching suspicious individuals. When someone mails a letter to another person through the postal service, it is enforced by law that the letter can only be opened by its addressee--or an individual with the addressee's permission. While it is true that our acceptance of the terms and conditions (which we never read) of these email services indicate that we 'consent' to having our conversations monitored, the idea that our personal email exchanges are read by another entity can be troubling enough to discourage us from using email altogether. But the convenience of email is enough to keep us from switching back to using 'snail mail' for our main communication. So what other choice do we have but to act blissfully unaware of the situation?
